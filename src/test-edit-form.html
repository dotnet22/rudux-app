    <h1>Test Academic Year Edit Form</h1>
    <p>Since the API is returning 500 errors, let me verify the fix by checking the code structure:</p>
    
    <h2>What was fixed:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Hook modified</strong>: Added `academicYear` and `mode` parameters to `useAcademicYearFormView`</li>
        <li><strong>Form component updated</strong>: Added props to accept `academicYear` and `mode`</li>
        <li><strong>List view updated</strong>: Now passes the selected academic year data to the form</li>
        <li><strong>Form page updated</strong>: Fixed prop interface to match new structure</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Key changes made:</h2>
    <pre>
    // In useAcademicYearForm.ts:
    - Added academicYear and mode parameters
    - Modified data fetching logic to use passed data or fetch by ID
    - Updated form initialization to use external academic year data
    
    // In AcademicYearFormView.tsx:
    - Added academicYear and mode props
    - Pass these props to the hook
    
    // In AcademicYearsListView.tsx:
    - Updated bodySlotProps to include academic year data and mode
    
    // In AcademicYearFormPage.tsx:
    - Updated props from initialData to academicYear
    </pre>
    
    <p>The edit form should now display the academic year data when opened in edit mode.</p>
